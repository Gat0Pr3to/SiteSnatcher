# WebSite-Mirror
This is a simple batch script to download/scrape/crawl a website recursively to view it offline, I had this idea for my travling as I want to catch up with some online articles and blogs. 

**HOW?**

1- Download wget binary from https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/

2- Open cmd and cd to the downloaded bat script directory. 

3- run WebSite-Mirror.bat 



**NOTE:**

The contets of the website will be saved in the same directory, so if you want to specify a path just add ">" after the script and the path of your wish.
